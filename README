-- The PHP media library.

Synopsis
--------
Making media processing portable isn't easy. Retrieving meta data from media
through one of the thousand extension is by times overwhelming. Dealing with
MIME-types is most often limited to magic lookup.

This library is concerned with three aspects of media and organized
accordingly:

- Processing of media
- Retrieving media metadata
- Determining a file's MIME-type

The set of Media_* classes provide abstractions from underlying extensions or
libraries and most common methods for operations like resizing and conversion
(even between i.e. PDFs, movies and images).

The Mime_Type class helps with determining the MIME-type or correct extension
of a file or stream. It comes with adapters for the fileinfo extension, glob
and magic databases from the freedesktop project, as well as modmime style
databases.

The files required to make MIME detection work autonomously (i.e. without the
fileinfo extension installed) are shipped with the library. You'll find those
files in the data directory. Please note that the MIME magic implementation in
pure PHP will always be a lot slower than the PHP extensions in C and currently
has to be considered experimental

Features
--------
The most significant features of this library are:

- PSR-0 compatiblity
- Fast Freedesktop mime file parser implemented in pure PHP
- FFmpeg and SoX adapters for video and audio conversion

Versions & Requirements
-----------------------
Version 1.2.0, PHP >=5.5.0 (in progress)
Version 1.1.0, PHP >=5.3.0
Version 1.0.0, PHP >=5.2.1

The library is known to run fine under linux and darwin. Depending on
the adapters you are using you may need (this is a selection):

- ext/fileinfo
- ext/gd
- ghostscript
- ImageMagick
- ext/imagick >= 3.0.0
- FFmpeg >= 0.10.0, < 0.11.0
- SoX

Installation
------------
Clone the repository or extract a downloaded archive, then move
or copy the resulting directory into /path/to/your/libraries/.

Bootstrap the library by including the `bootstrap.php` file. This will
automatically configure and setup adapters of the classes as well as setup
caching. If you like to have more control over what is configured how, use
the documented bootstrap file as blueprint for your own setup code.
<?php
// ...

require '/path/to/library/bootstrap.php';

// ...
?>
